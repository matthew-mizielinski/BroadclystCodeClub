# Playing with Mu on the Micro:bit

## Micropython

Micropython is a version of python that can be used with the Micro:bit. The language itself is a cut down version of python 
with additional modules to connect to the various sensors on the microbit.

There are a number of clever things that can be done with micropython and a microbit, but the easiest way to get started is 
through a tool called Mu.

## Mu

Mu is a relatively simple editor that can compile and load code onto a connected Microbit, and read data from it in real time (see the
animation on their front page linked below).
