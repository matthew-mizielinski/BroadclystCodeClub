# *Bessie* the Bit Bot
*Dr Miz, September 2018*

Over the summer *Bessie*, previously controlled by a raspberry pi, has been rebuilt to work with a [Micro:bit](https://microbit.org)

## Make a face?

Before you can 

## Make code
There is a simple set of functions for controlling *Bessie* in [this makecode project](https://makecode.microbit.org/_Rqtes73Du51s) 
You can use the following functions;

| Function | Letter shown |Purpose |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `forward` | F |Start *Bessie* moving forwards |
| `backward` | B | Start *Bessie* moving backwards |
| `stop` | S |Stop *Bessie* |
| `left` | L |Turn *Bessie* left |
| `right` | R |Turn *Bessie* right |

In addition to these functions use the `pause` block to control how long each function is used for.

There are three combinations of buttons that you can use to get *Bessie* to run your code;
 * `A`: Initially runs a simple 6 second programme
 * `B`: Initially runs `stop`, to allow you to stop *Bessie* if your code has sent her out of control
 * `A + B`: Initially will just start *Bessie* moving forward
 
Use your imagination to come up with a sequence of moves for *Bessie* download the code into her Micro:bit and give it a try.

To control *Bessie* accurately you'll need to work out how long it takes to 

1. Turn 90&deg; 
2. Turn 180&deg; 
3. Move forward 10 cm
 
 Try a few experiments to see if you can work out how to control *Bessie*.

## Challenges

1. Can you make //Bessie// dance round in a circle?
2. Can you make //Bessie// move in a
    * Triangle?
    * Square?
    * Hexagon?
    * Figure of eight?
